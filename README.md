# Selena-Bus
Educational interactive game for my daughter

## Summary:

The purpose of 'Selena's Bus' is to provide my daughter with a custom mobile app learning experience.

Although there are a lot of options already out there, some of which she uses and enjoys, I wanted to develop something from scratch that my wife and I have full control over. 

The game, upon inception, is basically a Colors, Letters, and Numbers game covering some of the very basics for a young learner. The app will also include custom recordings of my voice to guide her through the activities.

Progress data is also tracked on the back-end and can be viewed and digested by us as parents to keep track of how she's doing, what she needs more work with, and when it's time to start building out more functionality so the app can grow with her as she learns. 

I can imagine adding more levels, content, and ideas in the future. The app is also very much in beta version with a few kinks that still need to be worked out.

I look forward to continuing development with this app and building it out to grow along with Selena on her journey of learning.
