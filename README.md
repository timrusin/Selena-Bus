# Selena-Bus
Educational interactive game app for my daughter

## Summary:

The purpose of Selena's Bus is to provide my daughter with a custom mobile app learning experience.

Although there are a lot of options already out there, some of which she uses and enjoys, I wanted to devlop something from scratch that my wife and I have full control over. 

The game, upon inception, will basically be a Colors, Letters, and Numbers game covering some of the very basics for a young learner. The app will also include custon recordings of my wife and my wife voices.  I also composed and recorded the orignal music within the application as well. 

Progress data is also tracked on the back-end and can be viewed and digested by us as parents to keep track of how she's doing, what she needs more work with, and when it's time to start building out more functionality so the app can grow with her as she learns. 

I can imagine adding more levels, content, and ideas in the future.
